After reading the [post on Price Tags](http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2014/11/04/the-daily-durning-back-and-forth-on-cacs/),
originally from [Karen Sawatzky's blog](http://karensawatzky.ca/2014/10/29/7868/), I got curious about getting a
geographic overview over the CACs in Vancouver in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

As opposed to the [teardown map](/blog/2014/09/05/vancouver-teardown-map/) the dataset is quite small, so there should 
be no problems viewing this on a mobile device. As always, map is below the fold.

<!-- more -->

Some of the property addresses did not match any address in the CoV open data property database, probably because the
developments are quite new and new addresses got assigned. In these cases I mapped the CAC property to a nearby property
and added the 'Mapped Address' field in the info pane. Enjoy.
